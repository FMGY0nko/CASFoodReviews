                This pekarna is located at Krakovski Nasip. I got a Slanik which is
                breadstick with salty frosting and a blue Fanta. The Slanik was very good.
                As soon as I took a bite I tasted the salty frosting which was very good as it
                was not too salty. The bread was also fresh and had a soft texture. This
                was my first time trying the blue Fanta and it had an interesting taste to it.
                The pekarna had all different types of pastries. The Pekarna was small but
                it had a lot of food and drinks. I also found it interesting that they had drinks
                that you don't see everywhere. The Slanik and Fanta I got were cheap and
                also the other prices were low.

            <p>
                The service is definitely something that this pekarna could improve on.
                When I came in they did not greet me but just looked at me. But when I
                ordered they were nice. The problem was also that they put the breadstick
                in a paper bag that was too small. But when I left they said goodbye in a
                nice way.

                The food at this restaurant was absolutely fantastic. The dumplings were perfectly cooked and packed with flavour. The sweet and sour chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with a tangy sauce that complemented the dish perfectly. The stir-fried beef was cooked to perfection, with a rich sauce that had me licking my plate clean. Each dish was expertly prepared and bursting with flavour. The food was so good that I found myself thinking about it for days afterward. The chef truly deserves an award for the delicious creations they've brought to the table. Overall, the food at this restaurant was outstanding, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some delicious Chinese cuisine.

                Thai Zone is a Thai restaurant in Bezigrad. It is a small fast food type restaurant with limited space. The price of the food is relatively cheap. I ordered the red curry and a water, and it cost me around 9 Euro (8 euro for the curry and 1 euro for the water). The red curry was delicious. It was served with chicken and rice which paired amazingly with the warm curry. It was a perfect mix of aromatic and spicy. The spiciness of the curry was in my opinion perfect for the dish and expected from a Thai restaurant, but I can see how someone with a lower tolerance for spice could be put off. Overall, the food was delicious.

                The service wasn't anything special. It was exactly what you would expect from a restaurant. They weren’t overtly kind, but they weren’t mean in any sense of the word. We got our food quickly and there was nothing wrong with our order. The staff were polite but again nothing special.

                The food at this restaurant was fantastic and over exceeded expectations. We had 2 appetizers, tempura vegetables and tempura sushi. The tempura vegetables were incredible once paired with the sauce that the dish provides. On their own, they lack a bit in flavor and they aren't as crunchy as one would like. The tempura sushi made up for the other appetizer, it was phenomenal. It was worth the steep price point of 9.90 euros for 3 pieces. For the main courses, we had a salmon poke bowl and miso ramen. The poke bowl was underwhelming, it lacked in flavor and was overall dry. The ingredients used were primal and this bowl has a lot of potential but for the price point of 11.90 euros, it was not worth it. On the other hand, the miso ramen was outstanding, packed with rich flavor, and made with the best ingredients. Even though I am not a fan of ramen, this dish changed my mind.

                The service at Ondori surprised me because even though the restaurant was completely full,
                we were greeted by the owner as soon as we sat down. All the workers are super friendly and
                talkative. It was nice that the owner took our order and suggested what drinks we should pair
                our food with. His suggestion to take their homemade Japanese cherry lemonade paired
                perfectly with the poke bowl.

                This restaurant was one of the best Indian restaurants I ever went to. I
                ordered Multani Chicken Tikka, rice and Mango Lassi. The food was really
                fantastic. The Multani Chicken Tikka tasted very good as the meat was
                fresh and had a sweet like taste to it. The sauce that came with it had a
                creamy taste to it. Then the rice was also very good as it we cooked just
                right so it wasn't too soft or too hard. The Mango Lassi was so good that I
                was at a loss for words. Even Though the food was really expensive it was
                definitely worth it. Something that I also noticed was the presentation of the
                dish which made it look even more delicious.

                The service was also pretty good. When I had to wait for some time to
                order, the lady that served me was very nice and recommended the Mango
                Lassi. The wait for the food was not that long. What I think was really nice
                was that the lady asked me if the food was good when I was finished with
                eating. Overall the service was much better than it seemed at first.

                Out of all the Thai places in Ljubljana,
                DA BU DA serves the best pad thai and stir fry. We ordered spring rolls which were
                recommended by the waiter, and chicken pad thai. The spring rolls were 8.50 euro while the
                chicken pad thai was 13.80 euro. The prices are steep for a Thai restaurant but the food
                makes it worth every penny. We weren't set on what appetizer to order and the waiter
                recommended the spring rolls, which were a 10/10 recommendation. They prepare them in a
                unique way, which I have never seen before. The price point for them was a bit steep as you
                only got 6 spring rolls for 8.50 euros, but nonetheless, they were delicious. The pad thai on
                the other hand consisted of fresh ingredients and the taste was mind-blowing, but what it was
                mising in my opinion was more of a citrusy flavour as the one lime provided was not enough.
                Still, it was a 9/10 dish. The pad thai on its own is big enough to feed you to the brim, which
                gives great value for money.

                The service was quite shocking in a good way. When we arrived at the restaurant, it
                was packed. Despite having only three waiters, we still received one waiter's undivided
                attention. I enjoyed that he took the initiative and recommended an appetizer when he saw
                that I struggled with what to order. That recommendation was incredible, I am thrilled that
                DA BU DA has interactive waiters who are patient with customers and help with ordering
                food and recommending new cuisine.

                The street food restaurant is located on Kolodorska ulica 14, one street away from Intercontinental Hotel, and on the opposite side of the train/bus station. The food is always served in enormous amounts that certainly will make you feel full when you finish. But if you do not you can always take it with you, as they already serve it in plastic containers. You can choose between a variety of dishes, both spicy and not, that cost between 5to 15 euros. Also, next to your main course of meat you will receive a bowl of rice, 2 traditionally made eggs, and a small amount of onion for a complete experience. The quality of the food is amazing but considering it is a street food restaurant, the food takes a little bit too long, and it would be better if more people could sit at the spot.

Even though it is not the place where you can sit in, you can aways take your order for take away, which is ready in a maximum of 30 minutes, and eat it at home, in school, or anywhere else. The worker who takes your order speaks both English and Slovenian, so you will not have to worry about language problems.

                The Korean Street Food is a small fast food place on Trubarjeva street.
                This place was much better than I expected it to be. I ordered Korean fried
                chicken with sweet and spicy sauce. The chicken had a really good taste
                as it was sweet and pretty spicy at the same time. For someone like me
                who doesn't have a good spice tolerance it was too spicy but despite that I
                enjoyed the dish. The chicken also tasted very fresh. Something that wasn't
                good was that the chicken came with no rice or any other things which I
                personally think is necessary especially if you are eating a spicy dish. For a
                fast food place the prices are pretty high especially the chicken that I got
                was expensive.

                The service was very good as the people greeted me when I walked. When
                I ordered they were also very nice. I didn't wait long for the food. When I
                received my meal they told me to enjoy it and said goodbye in a nice way.
                Overall I think this service is really good for a fast food restaurant.

                It isn't just tasty, but it is also cheap, healthy and fills you up. The food they offer is predominantly Balkan based, such as jufka, kebab and burek, but they also have pizza slices and hamburgers. All the products are freshly made on the spot, with a variety of ingredients you can put your meal together from, such as vegetables and sauces. However, the only thing you aren’t going to find here is pork meat, since most of the workers are Muslims, and even touching pork goes against their beliefs, so you will have to choose chicken and/or beef. Any of the choices on the menu cost between 3 to 7 euroes. I rate the food 10/10, because it satisfies you in any part of the day, and it is assured that the food will always taste great.

                Nobel Burek is a 24-0 fast food restaurant chain located all around Ljubljana. Even though they are almost always full of customers; you can get your other in no more than 10 to 15 minutes. All the places are clean and hygienic when it comes to street food like this. In addition, which is the most important in service, is that the servers who pick up your order are always friendly, and with no exemption all of them speak at least basic English. Overall, I would rate the service as 9/10, as compared to other fast-food chains like Mc Donald’s, the service can take up a little more time.

        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>
            We are students at Gimnazija Bežigrad, with diverse ethnic backgrounds who decided
            to create a food review website. We realized a common problem people face when visiting a
            new country is finding a good restaurant. Through our website, this can be avoided. Our goal
            is to provide informative reviews analyzing the quality of food and service at various
            bakeries, restaurants, and fast food to ensure the user an enjoyable culinary experience. Our
            target audience is international students who have yet to experience all Ljubljana has to offer.
            And through our website, a glimpse of Ljubljana can be captured.

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>
            Although each reviewer working for this site, has their own unique ways of doing things, there is still a general methodology everyone follows. Firstly, the restaurants are picked communally rather than by the reviewer. We pick which restaurants to review primarily off of their reputation and price points. We generally prefer cheaper restaurants as they are more appealing to our user base of predominately young tourists. When visiting a restaurant, the reviewer is focused on two main aspects: the food and the service. In regard to food, the reviewer typically orders a popular and/or speciality dish from the restaurant with whatever sides they wish. The dish is then assessed according to its taste, texture, uniqueness, size, and price. Based off of these five factors the reviewer will evaluate the dish along with any other food ordered at the restaurant. For the service the reviewer will account for the cleanliness of the restaurant, how polite the staff are and the speed of service. After assessing both the food and the service, the reviewer will determine their final rating for each category and then the reviewer can create the overall rating of the restaurant.
